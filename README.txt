An eclectic collection of scripts and tricks that leverage fzf [1] to let me
sift through things.

Uses asciinema [2] for recordings.


edit-ansible.sh ----------------------------------------------------------------

    It just opens in your $EDITOR a view that contains only the configuration
    for the project you want, in the environment you chose (possibly all at
    once).  You edit that view, save its content and it gets magically merged
    back into the gigantic original document.
